1) for any POJO class to be a bean we need to specify by using @component annotation
2) there are two scop for standalone class 1)singleton 2) prototype.
	Singleton: object of bean created only once while initializing the spring container, 
				no matter how many time object of this bean is called
	Prototype: object of this bean is created only when we call the bean. no of times bean is
				called same no of object is created. object of this bean is not created when
				spring container is initializing. @scop(value="prototype") annotation
